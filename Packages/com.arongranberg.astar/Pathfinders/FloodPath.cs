namespace Pathfinding {
	/// <summary>
	/// Calculates paths from everywhere to a single point.
	/// This path is a bit special, because it does not do anything useful by itself. What it does is that it calculates paths to all nodes it can reach, it floods the graph.
	/// This data will remain stored in the path. Then you can calculate a <see cref="FloodPathTracer"/> path. That path will trace the path from its starting point all the way to where this path started.
	/// A FloodPathTracer search is extremely fast to calculate compared to a normal path request.
	///
	/// It is very useful in for example tower defence games, where all your AIs will walk to the same point but from different places, and you do not update the graph or change the target point very often.
	///
	/// Usage:
	/// - At start, you calculate ONE FloodPath and save the reference (it will be needed later).
	/// - Then when a unit is spawned or needs its path recalculated, start a FloodPathTracer path from the unit's position.
	/// It will then find the shortest path to the point specified when you calculated the FloodPath extremely quickly.
	/// - If you update the graph (for example place a tower in a TD game) or need to change the target point, you calculate a new FloodPath and make all AIs calculate new FloodPathTracer paths.
	///
	/// Note: Since a FloodPathTracer path only uses precalculated information, it will always use the same penalties/tags as the FloodPath it references.
	/// If you want to use different penalties/tags, you will have to calculate a new FloodPath.
	///
	/// Here follows some example code of the above list of steps:
	/// <code>
	/// public static FloodPath fpath;
	///
	/// public void Start () {
	///     fpath = FloodPath.Construct (someTargetPosition, null);
	///     AstarPath.StartPath (fpath);
	/// }
	/// </code>
	///
	/// When searching for a new path to someTargetPosition from let's say transform.position, you do
	/// <code>
	/// FloodPathTracer fpathTrace = FloodPathTracer.Construct (transform.position,fpath,null);
	/// seeker.StartPath (fpathTrace,OnPathComplete);
	/// </code>
	/// Where OnPathComplete is your callback function.
	///
	/// Another thing to note is that if you are using an NNConstraint on the FloodPathTracer, they must always inherit from <see cref="FloodPathConstraint"/>.
	/// The easiest is to just modify the instance of FloodPathConstraint which is created as the default one.
	///
	/// \section flood-path-builtin-movement Integration with the built-in movement scripts
	/// The built-in movement scripts cannot calculate a FloodPathTracer path themselves, but you can use the SetPath method to assign such a path to them:
	/// <code>
	/// var ai = GetComponent<IAstarAI>();
	/// // Disable the agent's own path recalculation code
	/// ai.canSearch = false;
	/// ai.SetPath(FloodPathTracer.Construct(ai.position, floodPath));
	/// </code>
	///
