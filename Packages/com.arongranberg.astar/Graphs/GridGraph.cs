	/// <summary>
	/// Generates a grid of nodes.
	/// [Open online documentation to see images]
	/// The GridGraph does exactly what the name implies, generates nodes in a grid pattern.
	///
	/// Grid graphs are excellent for when you already have a grid-based world. But they also work well for free-form worlds.
	///
	/// See: get-started-grid (view in online documentation for working links)
	/// See: graphTypes (view in online documentation for working links)
	///
	/// \section gridgraph-features Features
	/// - Throw any scene at it, and with minimal configurations you can get a good graph from it.
	/// - Predictable pattern.
	/// - Grid graphs work well with penalties and tags.
	/// - You can update parts of the graph during runtime.
	/// - Graph updates are fast.
	/// - Scanning the graph is comparatively fast.
	/// - Supports linecasting.
	/// - Supports the funnel modifier.
	/// - Supports both 2D and 3D physics.
	/// - Supports isometric and hexagonal node layouts.
	/// - Can apply penalty and walkability values from a supplied image.
	/// - Perfect for terrains since it can make nodes walkable or unwalkable depending on the slope.
	/// - Only supports a single layer, but you can use a <see cref="LayerGridGraph"/> if you need more layers.

	/// \section gridgraph-updating Updating the graph during runtime
	/// Any graph which implements the IUpdatableGraph interface can be updated during runtime.
	/// For grid graphs this is a great feature since you can update only a small part of the grid without causing any lag like a complete rescan would.
	///
	/// If you for example just have instantiated an obstacle in the scene and you want to update the grid where that obstacle was instantiated, you can do this:
	///
	/// <code> AstarPath.active.UpdateGraphs (obstacle.collider.bounds); </code>
	/// Where obstacle is the GameObject you just instantiated.
	///
	/// As you can see, the UpdateGraphs function takes a Bounds parameter and it will send an update call to all updateable graphs.
	///
	/// A grid graph will assume anything could have changed inside that bounding box, and recalculate all nodes that could possibly be affected.
	/// Thus it may end up updating a few more nodes than just those covered by the bounding box.
	///
	/// See: graph-updates (view in online documentation for working links) for more info about updating graphs during runtime
	///
	/// \section gridgraph-hexagonal Hexagonal graphs
	/// The graph can be configured to work like a hexagon graph with some simple settings. The grid graph has a Shape dropdown.
	/// If you set it to 'Hexagonal' the graph will behave as a hexagon graph.
	/// Often you may want to rotate the graph +45 or -45 degrees.
	/// [Open online documentation to see images]
	///
	/// Note: Snapping to the closest node is not exactly as you would expect in a real hexagon graph,
	/// but it is close enough that you will likely not notice.
	///
	/// \section gridgraph-configure-code Configure using code
	///
	/// A grid graph can be added and configured completely at runtime via code.
	///
	/// <code>
	/// // This holds all graph data
	/// AstarData data = AstarPath.active.data;
	///
	/// // This creates a Grid Graph
	/// GridGraph gg = data.AddGraph(typeof(GridGraph)) as GridGraph;
	///
	/// // Setup a grid graph with some values
	/// int width = 50;
	/// int depth = 50;
	/// float nodeSize = 1;
	///
	/// gg.center = new Vector3(10, 0, 0);
	///
	/// // Updates internal size from the above values
	/// gg.SetDimensions(width, depth, nodeSize);
	///
	/// // Scans all graphs
	/// AstarPath.active.Scan();
	/// </code>
	///
	/// See: runtime-graphs (view in online documentation for working links)
	///
	/// \section gridgraph-trees Tree colliders
	/// It seems that Unity will only generate tree colliders at runtime when the game is started.
	/// For this reason, the grid graph will not pick up tree colliders when outside of play mode
	/// but it will pick them up once the game starts. If it still does not pick them up
	/// make sure that the trees actually have colliders attached to them and that the tree prefabs are
	/// in the correct layer (the layer should be included in the 'Collision Testing' mask).
	///
	/// See: <see cref="GraphCollision"/> for documentation on the 'Height Testing' and 'Collision Testing' sections
	/// of the grid graph settings.
	/// See: <see cref="LayerGridGraph"/>
