# Item Stats
In this tutorial we'll show you how to change an item's stats.

1. Find the ItemTemplate that you want to change.
2. Change some of its stats. (We recommend using Debug mode of the Inspector)
3. In Unity, on the top toolbar, select `Window/Asset Management/Addressables/Groups` to open Addressables Groups window
4. The modified template should be added to the list (we do it automatically when you saves any Template). If it's not there, drag and drop it to DefaultLocalGroup
5. Build mod with top toolbar `TG/Modding/Build`
6. Try if the mod is working in the game
