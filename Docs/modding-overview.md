# Modding Overview
The Merlin's Workshop allows you to replace Addressables assets in Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon.<br/>
It contains a simplified version of the game's source code with compatible mono scripts and some of its first-party assets.

Since asset bundles are rather limiting, only assets explicitly loaded through them can be replaced. You can find the list of such assets [here](Resources/guids.txt)

Due to licensing issues we cannot provide you with all the assets used in the game. It doesn't mean that you cannot replace them, but only that they are not shipped with this tool. In this project you can find mostly our templates (data containers) for items and npcs.

Before baking the mod you should fill in the appropriete fields of the [Mod Info](mod-info.md) asset.

We prepared few tutorials for you:
* [Materials in Drake (static geometry)](Tutorials/drake-material.md)
* [Item Stats](Tutorials/item-stats.md)
